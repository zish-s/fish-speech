"""Punjabi (Gurmukhi) to diacritic-aware Latin transliteration.

This is an OPT-IN preprocessing pass.
See PUNJABI_TRANSLITERATION.md in this directory for the
full mapping table and rationale.

Scheme summary (based on ISO 15919):
    - Long vowels get a macron:              ā ī ū ē ō
    - Retroflex consonants get a dot below:   ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ
    - Gemination (addak, U+0A71) doubles the following consonant. addak gemination implemented is independently verified against ICANN's Gurmukhi script proposal.
    addak doubles the next consonant, not the one before it.
    - Nasalization (bindi U+0A02 / tippi U+0A70) is marked with a
      trailing 'ṁ' attached to the syllable it modifies. Tippi is used in gemination for nasal consonants ਙ, ਞ, ਨ and ਮ.
    - Tippi is used for nasalization of vowels, but bindi is used for nasalization of consonants.
    - Tippi before a non-nasal consonant (ਜ, ਬ, etc.) → nasalize the vowel before it. 
    ਪੰਜਾਬ → paṁjāb.
    - Tippi before ਙ, ਞ, ਨ, or ਮ specifically → double that consonant, like addak does elsewhere. 
    ਕੰਮ → kamm, not kaṁm.
    - The inherent vowel ("schwa") that bare consonant letters imply
      is dropped or kept using the rule in `_apply_schwa_deletion`
    - consonants mapped are from official Unicode Standard, Gurmukhi block chart.
    - when a consonant is immediately followed by virama, mark its schwa as definitively cancelled (no need to guess, since virama explicitly says so), consume the virama, and let the next consonant start fresh right after it.
    - for schwa deletion - we delete the schwa at the literal end of a word, and within a run of adjacent bare consonants, alternate delete/keep starting from the rightmost one — which exactly reproduces the one full worked example from the issue.

LIMITATION: 
    - The transliteration does not handle all possible combinations of consonants and vowels, especially in borrowed words or names. Some combinations may not be accurately represented in the Latin script.
    - The transliteration does not account for regional variations in pronunciation (out of scope), which may affect how certain letters are pronounced and thus how they should be transliterated.
    - the unmarked/implicit schwa deletion rule is not always accurate since its not a direct part of ISO 15919, and may result in incorrect transliterations for some words. This is a known limitation of the current implementation.
    - The ISO 15919 standard is not fully implemented, and some diacritic marks may not be applied correctly in all cases. Users should be aware of this limitation when using the transliteration function.
    - strict ISO 15919 has no mechanism to silently drop schwas — it either writes "a" literally, or relies on a virama being present in the source text.
    - the schwa rule for deletion was derived from a single sentence, not a full phonological model, so it will get some real words wrong — there's no code fix that gets this to 100%, since even published Hindi schwa-deletion research doesn't reach that. Closing the gap means testing against a much bigger set of real words and native-speaker corrections over time, not a one-time patch.
